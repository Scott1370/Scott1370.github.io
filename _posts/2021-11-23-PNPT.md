# Certification - PNPT

 
 The Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification by [TCM Security](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) 
 
## About
 
 The PNPT certification is a entry-mid level Pentest cert which focuses on a variety of different topics. The exam is "real-world" and places a heavy focus on Windows Active Directory.

## Preparation

To prep for the exam, I recommend taking the [Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) , and the [External Pentest Playbook](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/external-pentest-playbook) at a minimum. The Both of these should give you enough to pass the exam however the [Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners) and [Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/linux-privilege-escalation) are also great choices to take a look at. At the time, I was pretty busy working on pentests at my job which supplimented for a bit of practice. HackTheBox & TryHackMe are both great options to practice, and learn specific skills. I utilized these for a few things I really wanted to get better at. After I had completed a few of the TCM courses, I was ready to schedule my test.


## The Exam
 
 Scheduling the exam is done though their online booking system, which allows you to pick which day(s) work the best for you. After picking a time, I got an email ffrom TCM confirming my selection. When the time comes, you are given an engagement letter which provides you with all the information you will need during the exam. 

 The exam lasts a total of 7 days which is broken up into two portions. The first is 5 days and is the actual testing phase. Here your goal is to traverse the network and hopefully obtain domain admin. After the time is up, your access to the environment is removed. The second portion is the reporting phase where you are instructed to write a report on the findings and then submit to the TCM staff. If your report is deemed worthy you will then have a 15 minute debreif to go over the findings. I had the opportunity to do mine with Heath himself (which was really awesome). After finishing the defreif, your certification will then be emailed to you. Make sure to check spam/junk as thats where mine was (thanks gmail). Here's mine below.

## Final Thoughts

If you are looking for a Pentesting/Red Teaming certification, I cannot recommend the PNPT enough. The exam is realistic and closely mirrored many of the things I see during real pentests. The exam was by no means easy, and stumped me in a few places to the point where I had to take a break and come back later with a fresh mind. If you happen to find yourself in the same position, take a quick break and come back to it later.  

TCM also has a very active Discord server for students and us infosec nerds. In the server you can ask questions about the courses, get support, and hang out.
